            How Renewable Is Australia Compared To The World?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Australia is a developed nation that is ranked 13 in the world in terms of economic output (GDP).
            The growth of Australia's economy also means that more energy needs to be produced and expended.
            Our country's renewable energy target is to achieve 80% by 2030 (80% of all energy produced is generated by renewable sources).
            This visualisation will give a short glimpse into how Australia compares to the rest of the world in terms of sustainable energy production as well as tracking our progress towards the 80% goal.

        <p>
            Looking at the map, it can be seen that Australia's renewable energy percentage is quite similar to that of other developed nations.
            However, Australia being a relatively young country, has a much smaller population and lower energy needs to be fulfilled.
            With that in mind, Australia's renewable energy production has the potential to be much higher.
            The countries with the highest share of renewable energy production are in the Scandinavian region.

            The line chart above compares Australia's renewable energy share alongside the 5 countries with the highest GDP.
            It also maps the progression of renewable energy produced from 1965-2021 for the aforementioned countries.
            From the chart, we can observe that Australia's investment into renewable energy sources has increased significantly since the last decade.
            We can also see that Australia's renewable energy share is greater than that of the US and Japan, however, it is lower than that of the UK, Germany and China.
            Furthermore, the UK and Germany have significantly increased their renewable energy share compared to where they initially started (~18% increase).
            Signifying that it is possible for Australia to achieve similar progression if enough investment is made.

        <p>
            The pie chart illustrates how Australia's renewable energy production is split among the 4 main sources (Biomass, Solar, Wing, Hydro).
            A majority of Australia's renewable energy is produced via solar and wind with hydro trailing behind while biomass only accounts for 4%.
            Australia looks to be investing into the right renewable energy sources given the countries geological features.
            Hydropower was one of Australia's most abundant forms of renewable energy, however the climate of Australia being as dry as it is, means that this form of energy production is very limited to areas which receive heavy rainfall.
            In contrast, the more prevalent renewable sources (solar and wind) are unaffected by the arid climate.
            Australia has the highest solar radiation of any country which can be harnessed by solar generators.
